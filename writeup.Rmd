# Estimating Desktop Browser Market Size

Desktop Firefox has been losing users for the past few years and we
have also been losing market share. We've generally attributed this to
a combination of Chrome taking our users and the generally declining
state of the desktop market.

We can use the combination of our user numbers (MAU), which we know,
and an external estimate of our market share to estimate the overall
size of the market. We have MAU values for each day of the month, but
market share only for a month as a whole. As an approximation, we
take the MAU value for the last day of the month and attribute it to
the month as a whole.

*TECHNICAL NOTE:* In the current version of this code, we actually
assign all these values to the first day of the month rather than
the last, which means that all the graphs are actually off by a
month or so. This doesn't affect the general trend, but I need
to write some code to fix it.


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ms.ww <- fread("browser-ww-monthly-200901-201910-first.csv")[,date:=as.Date(Date)]
ms.us <- fread("browser-us-monthly-200901-201910-first.csv")[,date:=as.Date(Date)]
mau <- fread("Desktop_MAU_in_US_and_ROW_2019_11_22-last.csv")[,date := as.Date(date)]
adi <- fread("adi-mean.csv")[,date := as.Date(date)]
nm.ww <- fread("netmarketshare.csv")[,date:=as.Date(date)]

# Trim these to the same dates
# First ADI
ms.adi <- ms.ww[date >= min(adi$date) & date <= max(adi$date)]
df.adi <- data.table(date = ms.adi$date, usage = adi$adi, share = ms.adi$Firefox/100)

# Then MAU for StatCounter
ms.ww <- ms.ww[date >= min(mau$date)]
ms.us <- ms.us[date >= min(mau$date)]
mau.st <- mau[date <= max(ms.ww$date)]
df.ww <- data.table(date = ms.ww$date, usage = mau.st$mau_row + mau.st$mau_us, share = ms.ww$Firefox/100)
df.us <- data.table(date = ms.us$date, usage = mau.st$mau_us, share = ms.us$Firefox/100)

# Finally MAU for NetMarketShare
mau.nm <- mau[date >= min(nm.ww$date)]
df.nm <- data.table(date = nm.ww$date, usage = mau.nm$mau_row + mau.nm$mau_us, share = nm.ww$Firefox/100)
```


## Worldwide Market Size

Fhe following figure shows the decline of MAU and market share from
the period of 2016-04-01 to 2019-10-01. The MAU data comes from our
own telemetry and the market share data comes from StatCounter.
Each of these is normalized to the start of the period. 
Note that market share is declining faster than MAU.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
df <- df.ww

df$size <- df$usage/df$share
df$usage.normal <- df$usage/df$usage[1]
df$share.normal <- df$share/df$share[1]
df.long <- gather(df, key="Source", value="Frac", usage.normal, share.normal)

res.ww <- df
 ```

```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df.long) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=Frac, color=Source))
```

We can get an estimate of the size of the market by dividing MAU
by our share of the market, giving us the graph below. Based on
this data, desktop market size has actually increased over
this period, from about 2 billion to about 3 billion. These numbers
do seem fairly high, but it's a straightforward calculation,
and we just need to assume that there's no systematic bias
in either of these measurements, then it would appear that
the market is growing.


```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=size))
```

## US Market Size


Here is the same treatment for the US, which shows the market size
as approximately flat at ~400 million users.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
df <- df.us

df$size <- df$usage/df$share
df$usage.normal <- df$usage/df$usage[1]
df$share.normal <- df$share/df$share[1]
df.long <- gather(df, key="Source", value="Frac", usage.normal, share.normal)

res.us <-df
 ```


```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df.long) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=Frac, color=Source))
```

```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=size))
```

## NetMarketShare

StatCounter is not the only source of market share data. This section runs
the same analysis for worldwide data pulled from NetMarketShare. I was
unable to get it to download a CSV, so I hand-transcribed it from their
dashboard, which shows values if you hover over the points. This may
have resulted in transcription errors and we should arrange to get
machine readable data.


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
df <- df.nm

df$size <- df$usage/df$share
df$usage.normal <- df$usage/df$usage[1]
df$share.normal <- df$share/df$share[1]
df.long <- gather(df, key="Source", value="Frac", usage.normal, share.normal)

res.nm <- df
print(res.nm)
print(res.ww)
```


```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df.long) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=Frac, color=Source))
```

```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=size))
```

## ADI

And finally, here's the same treatment for Average Daily Installs (ADI), which is based on the
blocklist ping rather than on telemetry data.


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
df <- df.adi

df$size <- df$usage/df$share
df$usage.normal <- df$usage/df$usage[1]
df$share.normal <- df$share/df$share[1]
df.long <- gather(df, key="Source", value="Frac", usage.normal, share.normal)

res.adi <- df
 ```


```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df.long) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=Frac, color=Source))
```

```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(df) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date, y=size))
```

## Summary

Finally, we can compare the each of these series by normalizing to the
value at the beginning of the MAU series (which starts later than ADI).
Because ADI is an unsmoothed value, we take the arithmetic mean of
ADI for each month. As before, we attribute it to the first day of
the month.

*TECHNICAL NOTE*: The netmarket share data is normalized against its first
appearance, in June 2016, one month later than the MAU series.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
res.ww$size.normal <- res.ww$size/res.ww$size[1]
res.us$size.normal <- res.us$size/res.us$size[1]
res.adi$size.normal <- res.adi$size/(res.adi[date == min(res.ww$date)]$size[1])
res.nm$size.normal <- res.nm$size/res.nm$size[1]
res.ww$series <- "WW MAU (StatCounter)"
res.us$series <- "US MAU (StatCounter)"
res.adi$series <- "ADI (StatCounter)"
res.nm$series <- "WW MAU (NetMarketShare)"
print(names(res.nm))
print(names(res.ww))
res <- rbind(res.ww, res.us, res.nm, res.adi)
```

```{r eval=TRUE,fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(res) + geom_line(mapping=aes(x=date,y=size.normal, color=series)) + geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=date,y=size.normal, color=series))

```

It's probably a mistake to read too much into these data sets (and in
particular the projections implied by smoothing are not reliable due
to seasonality), but a few points are worth noting. All of this data
generally show a market increase over the past few years (causeed by
market share decline outpacing absolute decline), coupled with big
spikes adound the beginning of 2019. These reflect two big negative
spikes in market share around the same time, so may be measurement
error in the market share estimates, and in any case will recur for
any absolute usage series we run against these market share
numbers. The NetMarketShare data does not show these big spikes
but overall tells a very similar picture to that for the
StatCounter WW data.

In general, this is a somewhat surprising result as we had expected
the desktop market to be generally flat to in decline, and so more
investigation is definitely required.


# Sanity Check

There are a lot of potential sources of noise in this data. As a sanity
check, let's compare the US data to an independent source, which is the
installed base of desktop and laptops in the US from Statista. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/670172/united-states-installed-base-desktops-laptops-tablets/]. This shows the market as being nearly flat
at around 310 million for the past few years, projecting to be 305
million in 2022, so at least we are on the same order of
magnitude.
